# संपूर्ण विद्यालय (Sampurn Vidhyalay) 
A University (Sampurn Vidhyalay) accepts a learner from within the globe as an input-building-block and produce an advanced learner as an output-building-block of global ecology. For this reason, universities are intrinsically and inherently sustainable.

## Overview
1. Universities host the largest selection or catalogs of alphabets, vocabulary and building blocks (models) for each industry via campuses
1. Schools within universities provide mutually exclusive philosophical views on categorizing and cataloging models
1. Colleges within schools create and utilize regularized procedures to act upon models. These frameworks are meant to achieve novel outcomes that can be catalogued by the parent school. Colleges define fields, work domains or disciplines through ratified frameworks
1. Centres exist at the boundary condition of schools to interconnect different colleges


## Arts
School of liberal arts accepts and promotes ratification via conceptions within any tangible medium. The medium can have multiple modalities that support human interactions and interfaces. Novel, highly complex, very subtle and non replaceable conceptions, interpretations and reinterpretations are acceptable.

Note: The abbreviation *dept* stands for department. 

school of liberal arts

  • college of education

  • college of history and anthropology

  • college of law and legal studies

    • dept of policing and compliance

  • college of visual arts and theater


The Following list of schools and colleges have highest degree of freedom in defining a scope and may radically redefine acceptable levels of precision and accuracy, for ratifying publications or productions, within and across schools

school of philosophy

  • college of metaphysics

    • dept of ontology and epistemology

    • dept of linguistics

    • dept of mathematics and computation

    • dept of cognition (study of general and artificial intelligence)

  • college of ethics and aesthetics

    • dept of civil conduct and morality

    • dept of military conduct and morality

  • college of spirituality

    • dept of theological studies

    • dept of aesthetics and valuations


### Sciences and Engineering
School of science accepts and promotes ratification through precise communication of replaceable models within a tangible medium.

school of sciences

  • college of foundational sciences

    • dept of astronomy and physics

    • dept of chemistry

    • dept of biology

    • dept of sustainability

    • dept of psychology

    • dept of sociology and governance

    • dept of information and communication


The Following list of colleges accept and promote accurate as well as precise communication of models within a limited scope. The scope defines the boundaries of the respective colleges. Different colleges arise due to differences in interpretation and application of founding principles as well as justification criteria inherited from parent school.

  • college of applied sciences

    • dept of design and engineering,

    • dept of economics and business

    • dept of medicine and therapy

    • dept of archeology

    • dept of geology and meteorology

    • dept of archiving (library sciences)

    • dept of sports, leisure and recreation

  • college of music

    • dept of vocal music

    • dept of instrumental music

  • college of military affairs

    • dept of cyberwarfare

      • centre for naval command (water surface and deep sea)

      • centre for aerial command (atmosphere and outer space)

      • centre for terrestrial command (land surface and underground)

   • dept of military communications

   • dept of martial law and policing

### Centres
Overlap and connectivity among colleges is supported by centres that can conduct activities with higher degrees of freedom compared to any single college but fewer degrees of freedom than the combination of all colleges across schools.

• centre for public policy and health

• centre for habitat planning (housing, towns, cities, nations, etc)

• centre for gender and sexuality studies

• centre for human rights protection

• centre for animal rights protection

• centre for natural resources protection

• centre for games studies

• centre for sports medicine and rehabilitation

• centre for emergency response and crisis management

Departments, laboratories, workshops, studios and houses within colleges along with centres collaboratively improve university wide management of simultaneously ongoing experiments and explorations among respective colleges and centres.


### Innovation
Any member of a university within any level of organization can independently contribute to the university's catalogs through publishable (publicly releasable) material. The novelty of a published material is subject to ratification. Eventually this setup causes the catalogs to grow and appreciate in overall value for human ecology. Improper ratification can lead to a depreciating catalog of compositions. Refurbishing and refreshing the catalogs is a routine chore necessarily taken up to mitigate harmful innovations as well as hazardous application of basic axioms and theorems.

### Property Rights and Ownership
The rules and regulations ratified by the colloquia of schools, colleges, departments and centres about the level and type of ownership of an indexable item catalogued by the university are prescribed to its members. Such rules and regulations are accepted upon subscription by or ascribing membership to a person capable of taking ownership and responsibility of being a university member. The legal structure of the university as a cooperative, a for profit, a not for profit or a hybrid entity bears significant impact on regulating membership and their ownership rights.

### Promotion and financial sustainability
Any member of a university within any level of organization can promote and sustain the principles and activities of a school through publicity, scholarship and teaching. The competence and compensation of a member for doing so is subject to ratification and justification by respective schools.

### Funding
• Tax appropriations

• Donations (unconditional)

• Private funding with contractual obligations and conditions

• Endowments with stipulated conditions

### Campuses
• A campus is a collection of buildings and facilities that support at least a college.

• Campus may support closely or remotely located college buildings.

### Campus and academic administration
Various specialized chores of managing campus facilities, grounds, residences and materials as well as coordinating campus members can be given to teaching as well as non teaching staff.

### Private companies and organizations
• Companies and organizations not under the administration of a university typically have a scope of activities smaller than that of a university college.

• Large organizations, corporations and conglomerates often have similar structure and behavior compared to universities

### Cities, states or provinces and nations
• Such organizations are an extrapolation and geographical expansion of the structure and function of universities.

• Universities are not a restricted, diminutive or miniaturized form of cities, states nor nations because universities evolve faster than them while autonomously creating and housing their "blueprints"
